Create a python file called **decisions3.py** and upload it to this repo. At the beginning of the python file, write a description of the program(s) in a comment. 8.	When you work more than 44 hours a week in Ontario you are paid overtime. Overtime pay is 1.5 times your hourly pay.

For example, an employee who has a regular rate of $17.00 an hour will have an overtime rate of $25.50 an hour 
(17 × 1.5 = 25.50). The employee must therefore be paid at a rate of $25.50 an hour for every hour worked in excess of 44 in a week.

Write a program that reads a number of hours worked in a week and an hourly pay from the user and outputs the total amount paid, including overtime if applicable. All outputs should be displayed using 2 decimal places.

&nbsp;&nbsp; **Sample Input**

    011

&nbsp;&nbsp; **Sample Output**

    no
